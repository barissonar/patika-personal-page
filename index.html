     <h3><strong>About</strong></h3>

     <p style="width: 800px;">I was introduced to computers at a very young age, 
        I have been interested in the IT industry since my childhood. After graduating 
        from the Management Information Systems department in 2019, I actively worked 
        to improve myself in the field of software. During this process, after getting 
        to know various fields in the software industry, I realized that the field that 
        is most suitable for me and where I enjoy working the most is web programming, 
        and to improve myself in this field, I benefited from various books and online 
        trainings containing various web technologies, in addition to the web programming 
        training I received at university. During my internship, I worked on creating 
        e-commerce platforms with Django in a company that develops e-commerce platforms 
        on B2B and B2C business models, and during the internship, I gained the skills to
         work as a full stack developer by mastering the backend development side.</p>
